  ##  Impact of COVID-19 on Automotive Industry. ##

 ### Step A - About the problem ###

Impact of COVID-19 on Automotive Industry.
While the world economy came to the brink of a major global crisis due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the process had serious negative effects on the agriculture, retail and automotive sectors, especially in service sectors such as tourism, transportation and aviation. The automotive industry, which was already under pressure before the Covid-19 epidemic, was deeply affected during this epidemic process. With disrupted supply chains, falling demand and computers from home and short-term work plans, the automotive industry is predicted to face much greater challenges. On January 23, 2020, with the closure of the factories as a result of the quarantine of the city of Wuhan in China, problems began to be seen in the automotive industry. Along with the epidemic, strict measures in major markets, curfews, consumer panic and economic uncertainties caused a serious decline in automotive sales.

### Step B â€“ Extra Details ###

COVID-19 has affected daily life and is slowing the global economy. This epidemic has affected thousands of people working in a place for a living. Many fields, sectors and professions were caught unprepared for this situation and suffered unforeseen losses. One of these areas is the automotive sector, and this sector is one of the sectors that suffered the most from the pandemic. The most important reason why the crisis was felt very severely in the automotive sector; The fact that approximately 80% of the industry's supply chain and the largest new vehicle sales market is located in China, the origin of the epidemic. Most of the data that I will receive will be obtained from statistical institutions and I provide additional data from other research and  news sources.When I prepare it, I faced some challenges . First one is, Covid-19 is very new and it still continue so that reason when I want to colllect some data for my project, I could not  collect enough. Second one is,  I thinked a lot when I choosed my topic because there are lots of topics that can be choose.I can collect enough data for my project. There are lots of suitable website that have same topic with my project. In later times, the files and data that I will use increase. Net amounts of documents, datasets or files will be determined in later stages.

### Senario  ###

This year we decided to buy a new car. But, we noticed that the prices have increased a lot compared to the last years. Since we couldn't afford to buy a new car, we decided to look for second hand products. But their prices were too high. We realized that, this was one of the effects of covid-19. Due to the decrease in production, the demand became unmet and car prices rose a lot with taxes.Having witnessed this process, I decided to examine this problem in my project.

### Visualization Tool ###
There are some data visualization tools that I will use while doing a detailed analysis of this project. I chose to use the pyhton because it is easy.
